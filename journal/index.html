        <p>I agree with the article’s points about form design! It’s so important to take into account how data is gathered and lighten the mental toll of forms. UX Design starts with user research and a huge part of the research depends on quantitative data. As a UX researcher, I understand that filling out forms for my fellow researchers is important, but it’s also mentally tiring for me to fill out forms. If we have better practices of form design, it will increase the rate of people completing forms and gaining better insight.<br><br>Forms are also the first thing that new users will face to potentially become loyal users, so designers need to make this process as easy and smooth as possible. As the article says, having a difficult first question decreases the completion rate of the form. One of my favorite forms that I’ve filled out is the <a href="https://www.getcalfresh.org/en/apply">CalFresh application form</a> which includes a single short question per page and has the question written as the sub-header. This makes the process easier for me to answer the question as the first thing that I read is the question and the body text helps me understand why they need this information.</p>
